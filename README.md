This is the repository for the Autumn school group work
work flow:
1- Use the scenario projections for Germany for the private car transport demand by 2050 in pkm for three narratibes (SSP1-SSP2 and one for sufficiency i.e., less demand (LED)-----> delivery: pkm demand in 2050 
2- Use premise to estimate the amount of cars needed to deliver the function unit (pkm/yr) for passenger car electric 
----> delivery: number of cars need to provide the function unit
3- MFA to transport the stocks by 2050 into inflow and outflow ------> delivery: socks turn into inflows and outflows
4- use LCA again to link the inflows and outflows and estmate the environmental impacts in GWP, IPCC method
5- produce graphics and discussion.
